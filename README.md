# About 
 Using Amazon SageMaker to build, train, and deploy a machine learning (ML) model using the XGBoost ML algorithm.
 This machine learning model is focused on predicting whether a customer will enroll for a certificate of deposit (CD).
 The model will be trained on the Bank Marketing Data Set that contains information on customer demographics, responses to marketing events, and external factors. The data has been labeled for your convenience, and a column in the dataset identifies whether the customer is enrolled for a product offered by the bank. A version of this dataset is publicly available from the Machine Learning Repository curated by the University of California, Irvine.

# What I did 
- Created a SageMaker notebook instance
- Prepare the data
- Train the model to learn from the data
- Deploy the model
- Evaluate your ML model's performance


Tools
- Jupyter Notebook: 
- Amazon SageMaker: a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy ML models quickly.
- XGBoost Machine Learning algorithm: is a popular and efficient open-source implementation of the gradient boosted trees algorithm. Gradient boosting is a supervised learning algorithm, which attempts to accurately predict a target variable by combining the estimates of a set of simpler, weaker models.
