# About 
I built a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will enroll for a product offered by a bank. The model was trained on the Bank Marketing Data Set, which contains information on customer demographics, responses to marketing events, and external factors. The data has been labeled and a column in the dataset identifies whether the customer is enrolled for a product offered by the bank.

# Workflow
- Label data
- Created a SageMaker Jupyter notebook instance
- Prepare the data
- Train the model to learn from the data
- Deploy the model
- Evaluate your ML model's performance


# Tools

- An Amazon SageMaker notebook instance is a fully managed machine learning (ML) Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) compute instance that runs the Jupyter Notebook App. You use the notebook instance to create and manage Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing and to train and deploy machine learning models.

- The XGBoost algorithm is a popular and efficient open-source implementation of the gradient boosted trees algorithm. This algorithm is used to improve the accuracy of predictions by combining the estimates of a set of simpler, weaker models.
